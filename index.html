                    <p>Being creative and Bold is what defines Paridhi Nindra.
                        I'm a cross between a computer geek, designer, and artist. (I've been all of them at one time or another). I have worked in both corporate and non-profit organizations. Design and art were something that started initially during school days. At that time, I attended various workshops on arts and drawings, which got me a new hobby, and I used to love what I was doing. So, I started giving sessions on drawing at various schools to get a small source of income. I also used to provide sessions for free to multiple non-profit organizations where there were people who couldn't afford art and drawing classes.
                        After getting positive feedback from friends and relatives when they saw my artwork, I started making drawings for clients. I did make a few of the arts, which got me a good amount of money.
                        Then after school ended, I had to pursue college, so I decided to go for a bachelor's in computer application to learn about programming.
                        This course was relevant to my interest also with this I can get into the computer field. I was so dedicated from day 1 of the college that I did well and topped my batch. I was also awarded as a batch topper of that year. Then I got placement from a few IT companies like Capgemini, Mother Sumi, and others. But I decided to pursue Post Graduate Certificate in Information Technology Business Analysis – Operations from Conestoga College, Canada. During my graduation, I worked a few part-time jobs to fulfil my expenses, making me a confident and independent person.

                <p>While pursuing a post-graduate certificate in Information Technology Business Analysis – Operations from Conestoga College, I was trained to be Business Analyst in today's data-driven digital economy. During this period, I learned the various essential aspects and roles of a business analyst. It helped to bridge between the business concepts and business powers as it solves the future of business and plays a significant role in an organization with the help of identifying, designing, and scoping valuable changes and enhancements of business processes. 
                    With the help of this field of study, I got the knowledge of a successful business analyst, which gave me solid technical abilities, solid communication and listening skills, the ability to solve problems, and outstanding time management skills. This profession has given me industry knowledge to understand better the business analysis that will benefit both the organizations and me. Also, it has identified the needs of the participants and provided them with recommended solutions for how to achieve their business goals with a variety of business changes and enhancements. Business analysts can articulate complex transformation processes and business needs clearly and help business owners understand the changes needed and focus on what is essential to help sustain their business success.
                    So, this role has various advantages to having these technical professionals on board as a part of your business group. It is also valuable in their ability to increase benefits and explain complex change processes within an organization by determining and prioritizing business needs to reduce company costs effectively.

                        There are a few applications like code blocks; Microsoft visual studio's and hands-on experience with these tools have helped me develop applications with the help of programming languages.

                    There were primarily regular activities to work in villages, slums, and voluntary agencies during the academic year. As per the fundamental principles of NSS, one has to remain in touch with the community. During this tenure, there were various weekly special camping programs with the community members to learn from their experiences.

So like they have camped on various college campuses, like on our campus, I got a chance to volunteer work for them. I had the students get on board and aware of the blood donation, which was helpful for both others and themselves. I had to maintain the students' records, assisting the members of the hospitals of the blood bank to smooth the process.

                <p>As per my academics and work experience, I have gained relevant skills that make me a suitable candidate for the business analyst role. The combination of technical and soft skills makes me the perfect candidate for this role, where technical skills will help me enhance and deliver the project as per business requirements. In contrast, soft skills will allow me to gain deals from clients for the organization. During my academic and internship, I have worked on my technical skills a lot which makes me confident enough to deliver the project as per requirement. Also, from the experience of working in multi-national companies as an intern, I have an idea of working long hours and under hectic pressure, which I had handled pretty well in my intern days. 
                    During pursuing information technology business analysis, I learned how to deliver the business requirement as per the organization. With knowledge of vast tools and applications, I will meet business requirements, which will help the business grow. I have also worked for a small business where I needed to learn about time management as it was part-time jobs where I had to multi-task various things at once. At those times, also with loads of workloads, I could still handle the number of clients in a day without any issues.
                    All these skills like time management, working under pressure, and adding on technical skills with relevant knowledge of various applications make me the perfect candidate for the business analyst role to bring value to the organization and complete projects as per business requirements.</p>
